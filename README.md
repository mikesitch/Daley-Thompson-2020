This is an update to the classic 1984 game for the ZX Spectrum, which I loved, but always wanted it to be a little different so here is the result.  

The updates include:

* All 10 events in a single game.  It used to drive me nuts that days 1 and 2 were individual games on either side of the tape.
* Having to take all 3 throws/jumps even when you nailed qualification on the first was annoying.  In this version once you achieve the qualification standard you move on.  The Pole Vault and High Jump events start at the qualification height.
* Modern standards: You're now disqualified on the first false start (previously you were allowed 3 attempts of jumping the gun).
* Fixed some bugs: On the running events you can't let the clock roll over and run the 400 metres in 0.2 seconds!
* Stamina: The 1500 metres is now run in full.  This is one to test the wrists.
